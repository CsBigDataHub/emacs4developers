* Emacs for developers - The basics

**  Config files

In order to customize Emacs, you will have to edit its configuration files.
It does not exist when you install the software (or is an empty file) and does nothing until you decide to tweak Emacs.
Some people use Emacs for decades without any extra configuration because they like it out of the box.

There are several ways to manage your Emacs configuration:

- Simply create and edit a *~/.emacs* file
- Create a *~/.emacs.d/* directory with a *~/.emacs.d/init.el* file

The first solution is great if you have a small, tidied and exportable configuration file.

The second solution is great if you need several configuration files (keep you configuration parts separated) or you need to install external extensions (you will install them in *~/.emacs.d* to keep them centralized and exportable).

** Executing commands

The main idea of Emacs is that everything is a command. For example: opening a file with a keybinding calls a command that is executed by the Emacs' core.
And all the commands are written in Lisp.

To call a command, you simply have to press *Escape* and then *x*.
The official name is "/Meta x/" and is written /M-x/

If you type this key sequence, you will see at the bottom of the editor a little prompt.
This part of Emacs is called the /mini buffer/ and is used for every interactive actions.

Let's try something:

- type *M-x*
- Then, in the minibuffer, type *version*

Emacs should display the current version number of the software.

Congratulation, you called your first Emacs command.

** Key bindings

Here are the most useful keys in Emacs. You will use it several hundred (or thousand) times a day.

How it works:

- The sequence /C-something/ means that you have to press and hold the /Control/ key while hitting the /something/ key. Example: /C-a/ means /Control + a/.
- The sequence /C-something somethingelse/ means that you press /Control + something/, then you release Control to hit /somethingelse/.
- The sequence /C-something C-somethingelse/ means that you have to press Control while hitting /something/ and /somethingelse/.

*** Manipulate files

- *C-x C-f*: open a file
- *C-x C-s*: save a file

*** Manipulate the line

- *C-a*: go to the begining of the current line
- *C-e*: go to the end of the current line
- *C-k*: cut the rest of the line at the cursor position
- *C-y*: paste what you had cut with the command above
- *C-l*: center the buffer at the cursor position

*** Windows

This might be confusing but a /window/ is a part of a /frame/.

An /Emacs frame/ is the window that you opened when you launched Emacs.

An /Emacs frame/ can be divided into /windows/ in itself.

- *C-x 2*: open a new window horizontally
- *C-x 3*: open a new window vertically
- *C-x o*: switch to the next window
- *C-x 0*: close a window

*** Buffers

A /buffer/ is displayed in a /frame/.

- *C-x b*: switch to an already opened buffer
- *C-x C-b*: list opened buffer (and jump to the selected one)
- *C-x k*: kill a buffer

*** Cancel a command

- *C-g* or *ESC ESC ESC*: cancel the current command running in the minibuffer

*** The most useless one

- *C-x C-c*: quit emacs (use at your own risks!)

** Help!

Emacs has a powerful built-in help system for key bindings and internal functionalities.

- *C-h f <function-name>*: Find the key binding corresponding to <function-name> (ex: C-h f save-buffer)
- *C-h k <key-sequence>*: Find the function name corresponding to <key-sequence> (ex: C-h k C-x C-s)

When executing these commands, a new frame opens. To close it, switch to it (/C-x o/) and type /q/. If not, simply close it (/C-x 0/)

Emacs also includes the full manual (also available online: http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/)

- *C-h r*: browse the Emacs manual within Emacs
