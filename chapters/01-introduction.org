* Emacs for developers - Introduction

** Brief history

- Originally developed by Richard Stallman and Guy Steele in MIT AI lab
- First release in 1976
- Inspired by TECO editor
- Based on macros (Emacs stands for Editor MACroS)
- Written in C and Emacs Lisp
- Part of the GNU project (therefore, we /should/ say "GNU Emacs", not "Emacs")

- Despite its age, new users are still adopting Emacs as their development platform to this day!

** How to get Emacs?

On every Linux distribution, packages are available.
So run your favorite package manager to install it:

- /apt-get install emacs/
- /yum install emacs/
- ...

And if you have an exotic operating system, here are the specific distributions:

- Mac OS X: http://emacsformacosx.com/
- Windows: http://ftp.igh.cnrs.fr/pub/gnu/emacs/windows/

But, in order to get the latest version, it's _highly recommended_ that you compile Emacs yourself: http://ftp.igh.cnrs.fr/pub/gnu/emacs/


** More than an editor

- More than an editor, it is a Lisp interpretor
- Can run any type of program written in Lisp:
  - Email clients (like [[http://www.gnus.org/][Gnus]] or [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/mu4e][mu4e]])
  - Shell (like bash or eshell)
  - File and directory management (with [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html][Dired mode]])
  - Agenda / Notes / TODO list / Project management (with the amazing [[http://orgmode.org][OrgMode]])
  - IRC / Twitter / Jabber / ... clients
  - Games (like Tetris, Pong, Snake, 5x5, Dunnet, ...)
  - Encrypt/decrypt files (like GPG files)
  - On-the-fly archives editing (thanks to [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ArchiveMode][archive-mode]])
  - PDF / Image / (...) viewer
  - A powerful front end to R / S+ / SPSS / Stata (with [[http://ess.r-project.org/][EmacsSpeaksStatisics)]]
  - An editor for multi-modal REPL's like IPython (with [[http://tkf.github.io/emacs-ipython-notebook/][EmacsIPythonNotebook]])
  - Music player (with emms, vlc, mplayer, ...)
  - Music programming (with [[http://vimeo.com/22798433][Overtone]])
  - Video editing
  - And so on ...
  - (and of course a document editor that can automatically generate this presentation)

Naturally, you can do all of that at the same time with only one Emacs instance. Don't need to say it ...

** The perfect development tool

- As Emacs is a Lisp interpretor, it is extensible. Really really extensible.
- The (unofficial) goal of Emacs is to be hacked
- Therefore your goal is to hack Emacs to make it work perfectly as you want

- Already provides so many development tools (also extensible, of course)
  - Debuggers
  - Compilers
  - Syntax checkers
  - Documentations
  - Consoles
  - ...

- Also provides /modes/ (extensions) for *every* programming language for
  - Syntax highlighting
  - Documentation search
  - Indentation
  - Source code browsing
  - Compilation commands
  - Specific behaviour
  - ...
