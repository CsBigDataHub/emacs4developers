* Thanks

I want to thank some of the great people who make Emacs a very intersting piece of software or make its community very active (the sort order is absolutly not important here):

Bastien Guerry, Dimitri Fontaine, Julien Danjou, Sacha Chua, Steve Purcell, Nic Ferrier, Avdi Grimm, Magnars, Steve Yegge, Bozhidar Batsov, Xah Lee, and many more ...

You should check those people and their work over the web, twitter, youtube, ...

And thank you for reading this !
